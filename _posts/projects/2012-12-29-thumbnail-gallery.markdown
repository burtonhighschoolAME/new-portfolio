  caption: This is the third thumbnail that I am sharing with you. This one is special, because it has way more text than the other ones around it. I think that's pretty neat, but I'm sure there are some people who would beg to differ.

Here's the thumbnail gallery for this project! It's really neato! Here's some of the things I can do with this:

* Tell you about my project.
* Share images with you for you to browse at your leisure.
* Quickly add thumbnails by just making a list of thumbnails. It's that _simple_!
